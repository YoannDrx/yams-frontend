#  📚 Yams  (Yahtzee)

Hi,
I'm Yoann, I'm currently deepening my knowledge in web development. I'm specialized in React frontend development.
I had fun coding all these projects!
Feel free to ask me questions and don't hesitate to look at my other projects ;)
Have fun coding!

## ✍️ Description 

The objective of this challenge is to create a program that allows playing Yams (rules of the game: **[https://www.djeco.com/data/rules/DJ05224_EN.pdf](https://www.djeco.com/data/rules/DJ05224_EN.pdf)**).

- Part 1 :

The goal of this challenge is to set up the foundations of the Yams application, which will be divided into several parts over several days.

Today, you will need to integrate the mockup and prepare the components that you will use later.

- Part 2 :

Today, you will need to integrate the mockup and prepare the components that you will use later.
